# Evaluation CLI

The MongoDB Chatbot Framework comes with an Evaluation CLI that allows you
to evaluate the performance of your chatbot and its components.

Evaluation is important to ensure that the chatbot is providing accurate and relevant responses to user queries.
It also helps you measure the effect of changes to the chatbot's components
as you develop your application.

The CLI evaluates the chatbot's performance by comparing the chatbot's responses to a set of questions with the expected answers.
